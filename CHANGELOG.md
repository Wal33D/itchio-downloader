# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-23

### Security

- **API key moved from URL query params to Authorization Bearer header** — prevents exposure in logs, browser history, and referrer headers
- Path traversal guard on `desiredFileName` — rejects paths containing `/` or `\`

### Fixed

- **Browser race condition** — replaced global singleton with per-download browser instances; concurrent downloads no longer share or fight over a single browser
- **CDP compatibility** — updated from deprecated `Browser.enable`/`Browser.downloadWillBegin` to `Page.download*` events (Chrome 120+ compatible)
- **File rename race condition** — removed dangerous 2-second delay + unlink after rename; `fs.rename` is already atomic
- **Memory mode crash** — guarded path operations that ran `path.basename('')` when downloading to buffer only
- **Empty catch blocks** — all silently swallowed errors now documented or properly handled
- Flaky `waitForFile` tests stabilized

### Added

- `navigationTimeoutMs` param — configurable timeout for Puppeteer page navigation (default: 30s)
- `fileWaitTimeoutMs` param — configurable timeout for download file detection (default: 30s)
- 14 new edge case tests (42 → 56 total): path traversal, retry mechanism, API client auth, URL parsing, file rename edge cases
- New `itchApiClient.test.ts` test file

### Changed

- **ESLint rules re-enabled** — `no-explicit-any`, `no-unused-vars`, `prefer-const`, `no-empty`, `no-constant-condition` all enforced in source (relaxed in tests)
- All 100 lint violations fixed across 21 source files — `any` replaced with `unknown` and proper types throughout
- Updated Chrome user agent string to v141
- Process cleanup handlers only register once (prevents duplicate registration)
