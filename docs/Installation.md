# Installation

This project requires **Node.js 18+** because it relies on the built-in `fetch` API. If you have Node 16 or earlier, install a polyfill such as `node-fetch` or upgrade Node.

## Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add itchio-downloader
```

To install globally for the CLI:

```bash
pnpm add -g itchio-downloader
```

## Using yarn

```bash
yarn add itchio-downloader
```

If you installed the package globally, you can run `itchio-downloader` right away. When installed locally, use `npx itchio-downloader` or `pnpm dlx itchio-downloader`.
